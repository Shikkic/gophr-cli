#include <stdio.h> //This is line imports the standard input output library. It's a good library,  I use it alot. Input and Output operations can also be performed in C++ using the C Standard Input and Output Library (cstdio, known as stdio.h in the C language). This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently of the individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.

int  main(){//here we are crating the main function, it retunrs an int, which is short for an integer.
printf("gophring things");//This line prints out the string(or text) "gophring things", which is the incorrect way of spelling "gophering things".

//Pocket gophers, commonly referred to as gophers, are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae.[3] There are approximately 35 species of gopher living in Central and North America.[4] They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities. Gophers are endemic to North and Central America.
//
//The name "pocket gopher" on its own may be used to refer to any of a number of genera within the family. These are the "true" gophers; however there are several ground squirrels in the distantly related family Sciuridae that are often mistakenly called gophers as well.
